function [y,p] = majority(x)
% MAJORITY decision for a vector
%    Y = MAJORITY(X) returns the element of x with the most frequent 
%        occurence. The result will be biased towards lower elements
%    [Y,P] = MAJORITY(X) additionally returns the ratio to the next 
%        frequent element
% 
%    Example: If x = [0 0 1 1 1 0 3 3 4 4]
%             then [y,p] = majority(x) is y=0 and p=0.5
%
%             If x = [0 1 1 1 1 0 2 3 4 5]
%             then [y,p] = majority(x) is y=1 and p=0.6667
